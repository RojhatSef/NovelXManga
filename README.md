Hello! This is a project made by rojhat Sefdin aydal https://www.linkedin.com/in/rojhat-sefdin-aydal-387ab3220/

I love manga/anime, so i made a website, now this site is not 100% finished, however a lot of components are done. Some are even still progress. 
The website can add books(not all parts) on the website yet, but if you want to seed them it works, edit books(not all parts) this may be edite in the future.

This page was meant for showcasing/info on books. 
I use Microsoft SQL server managment studio(MSQSSM) & Visual studio 2022 

Step 1: First to run this, you probably going to need to have Visual Studio(2022). (i use it no other idea how it works with other IDE).

step 2: After you've cloned it, it's probably going to ask you to download the right frameworks. When this is finished, it's probably going to ask you to install the right.NET.

step 3: Open project manager console, in the default project, select MangaAccessService then in the PM> write: "update-database". This will start the creation of the database on your computer. (hopefully you use MSQSSM for databasing).
It's complete when you see the word "Done." 
To test it out choose either the NovelXManga, IIS express, or whatever you feel like. I recommend IIS express. 


I have no name stamp or anything that could link it back to me, but i would be very happy if you sent me a message on linkIn or Here. 

Best regards.
