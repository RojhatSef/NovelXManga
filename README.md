NovelXManga

Welcome to NovelXManga, a project created by Rojhat Sefdin Aydal. I'm passionate about manga and anime, which inspired me to build this website. While the site is not yet fully complete, many components are functional, and ongoing improvements are planned.
Project Overview

NovelXManga is designed to showcase and manage information about books, particularly in the manga genre. Here are some of the features and their current status:

    Add Books: Partially implemented. You can seed book data.
    Edit Books: Partial functionality available; further enhancements expected.

I've developed the project using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (MSSMS) and Visual Studio 2022.
Getting Started

To set up and run the project, follow these steps:
Step 1: Prerequisites

    Ensure you have Visual Studio 2022 installed. This project was developed with it, and compatibility with other IDEs hasn't been tested.

Step 2: Framework and Dependencies

    After cloning the repository, Visual Studio may prompt you to download and install the necessary frameworks and the correct version of .NET.

Step 3: Database Setup

    Open the Package Manager Console in Visual Studio.
    In the console, set MangaAccessService as the default project.
    Type update-database to create and configure the database on your local machine. Be sure you are using MSSMS for database management.
    You'll know the process is complete when you see "Done."

Running the Application

    To test the application, you can run it using IIS Express from Visual Studio.
