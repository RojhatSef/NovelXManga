    <p class="privacy-policy-text">
        At OtakuLibrary, we have established the following rules and guidelines for our users. Please read and adhere to these rules while using our website and services. Failure to comply with these rules may result in action being taken against your account.
    </p>

    <h2 class="information-collected-title">Content Restrictions</h2>
    <p class="information-collected-text">
    
        - Our library welcomes a diverse range of content, including books of various genres.
        <br />
        - Genres may include, but are not limited to: "Action," "Adventure," "Comedy," "Drama," "Fantasy," "Horror," "Romance," "Science Fiction," "Mystery," "Biographies," "Cookbooks," and many more.
        <br />
        - We encourage authors and publishers to share their work, provided it adheres to our community guidelines and legal regulations.
        <br />
        - Please ensure that the content you upload is appropriate for our audience, and adhere to age restrictions and content guidelines where applicable.
    </p>

    <h2 class="information-collected-title">Title Entry Guidelines</h2>
    <p class="information-collected-text">
        - Only scanlations (i.e. books translated and edited into another language) and self-published original books are allowed to be uploaded.
        <br />
        - Works with no text to translate, like artwork compilations, are not allowed.
        <br />
        - Scans of physical official releases or rips of digital official releases/webcomics from official sources, such as original releases (raws) or officially translated releases, are not allowed to be uploaded.
        <br />
        - The only exemptions to this rule are when:
        <br />
        - Permission has been granted by the publisher and/or creator;
        <br />
        - The uploader is the publisher;
        <br />
        - The license has expired;
        <br />
        - The series is out of print;
        <br />
        - The publisher is defunct; or
        <br />
        - The release can no longer be purchased via sources provided by the publisher.
        <br />
        - Releases qualifying under the previously mentioned exemptions should be uploaded under the group "[Publisher] (Ex-Licenses)" when applicable, and are treated as scanlations for the purpose of all rules.
        <br />
        - Do not upload the ex-licensed version if there is no significant difference in quality with available scanlations of the chapters in question.
        <br />
        - If a different publisher has created a different official release, the ex-licensed release from a previous publisher may still be uploaded.
        <br />
        - If the ex-licensed release from a publisher is relicensed by another company, it cannot be uploaded.
        <br />
    </p>
    <h2 class="information-collected-title">Title Creation Guidelines</h2>
    <p class="information-collected-text">
        - Do not add duplicate entries. Search for multiple alternate titles to confirm it doesn't exist yet before adding a series. Check your language and content filters to make sure you're not inadvertently hiding the work.    <br />
        - If there happen to be multiple distinct entries with the same title, do not add anything to distinguish them, such as "(Author name)". Use the actual title as it is.    <br />
        - Oneshots that were published in an anthology should be included in the respective anthology entry and should not have their own entries.    <br />
        - A single-chapter oneshot that has been serialized should have its own entry which is linked to the serialized entry using the "Serialization/Pre-Serialization" relation.    <br />
        - A non-user self-published book with multiple chapters that has been serialized should have its own separate entry. If the serialized book uses the same title, the pre-serialized entry should have "(Pre-Serialization)" or the equivalent appended to the main title.    <br />
        - Chapters that have been colored from a monochrome version (either Official or Fan Colored) should be uploaded under a separate entry that must be tagged as "Official/Fan Colored," have "(Official/Fan Colored)" appended to the main title, and include a "Colored" relation to the main title. "Official Colored" means the work was originally monochrome, and this is an official colored variant. Similarly, "Fan Colored" is reserved for non-official coloring of monochrome work. "Full Color" means the work was originally in color, and no monochrome version exists.    <br />
    </p>

    <h2 class="information-collected-title">Cover Art</h2>
    <p class="information-collected-text">
        - File type: JPG/JPEG, PNG, or GIF.    <br />
        - Portrait orientation.    <br />
        - Use the highest resolution available (minimum 300px * 450px).    <br />
        - All cover art should be unmodified and not translated by users. Officially translated covers can be uploaded and must be tagged with the correct language.    <br />
        - All titles must have a main cover.    <br />
    </p>

    <h2 class="information-collected-title">Chapter Release Guidelines</h2>
    <p class="information-collected-text">
        - A chapter as a whole must not exceed 500 images or 200MB in size.    <br />
        - Any individual image in the chapter must not exceed 20MB in size or 10000px * 10000px in resolution.    <br />
        - Images taller than 10000 pixels will be automatically split by the upload tool when uploading a chapter to a series tagged as longstrip.    <br />
    </p>

    <h2 class="information-collected-title">Groups</h2>
    <p class="information-collected-text">
        - Do not arbitrarily combine several chapters into a single release.    <br />
        - Chapters may only be split into parts if the source material was also split in the same way. Chapters that have been split up by the scanlators for any other reason may be recombined into singular whole chapters.    <br />
        - Do not combine book-style pages of a chapter into a vertical longstrip image (e.g., merging a book page with other book pages, credit pages, notes, etc). Double page spreads of paged content should be combined into a single page, as this is how they are intended to be read.    <br />
        - If you are not part of the scanlation group, do not alter the release you are uploading by any means.    <br />
        - Aggregator watermarks are not allowed. Watermarks from raw provider sites should be avoided when possible but are not explicitly banned.    <br />
        - Source uploads directly from the scanlator when possible. Avoid uploading compressed chapters from other aggregators unless there is no other option.    <br />
        - All content that isn't strictly part of the original scanlated chapter is considered "extraneous." Examples of this include credits pages, recruitment notices, discussion, fan-colored chapter pages, and other fan art. Extraneous content is generally allowed but must be placed either at the beginning or the end of the release.    <br />
        - Extraneous pages containing political content (such as agendas, propaganda, or commentary), race-baiting, or content that can reasonably be construed as offensive may be removed by Otaku Library staff. They are also subject to the same standards as listed out in the rules for Conduct and Comments.    <br />
        - Fan-colored pages not in a Fan Colored entry are considered extraneous and must not replace the original non-colored pages.    <br />
    </p>

    <h2 class="information-collected-title">Naming Conventions</h2>
    <p class="information-collected-text">
        - Fill in all the available information.    <br />
        - If the chapter has no title, do not add one.    <br />
        - Don't add your own made-up descriptors to any field, such as "[HQ]" or "v2" to the chapter title. The only allowed descriptors at this time are "Censored/Uncensored".    <br />
        - Only add volume numbers to chapters that have been published together in a volume. If the chapter has not been published in a volume yet, do not guess what volume it should be in, just leave the volume field blank.    <br />
        - For entries that use season numbering (such as some Korean webtoons), use the volume field for the season number.    <br />
        - Use decimals (1.1, 1.5, etc.) for chapters that are split into parts, or for bonus chapters/volume extras/etc.    <br />
    </p>

    <h2 class="information-collected-title">Code of Conduct</h2>
    <p class="code-of-conduct-text">
        - Misidentifying yourself as Otaku Library staff will result in a ban.    <br />
        - Otaku Library does not condone contacting groups about changing their restrictions or uploading their releases. If you are contacting a group, be polite, and make it clear you are not associated with Otaku Library.    <br />
        - Do not report any releases for any translation or visual quality issues that originate from the scanlator. These reports will be ignored, and your ability to make reports may be restricted.    <br />
        - The use of multiple accounts is permitted but not guaranteed protection. Using alternative accounts for rule-breaking or evading moderator action may lead to moderator action against all of your accounts.    <br />
        - Abusing any features of the website (such as titles, groups, reports, or covers) for the purpose of advertising, trolling, or other malicious behavior will result in a ban.    <br />
        - Data standardization of Otaku Library content metadata is solely decided by Otaku Library staff. Adding or editing content metadata en masse with the purpose of pushing some personal kind of formatting or standardization will result in moderator action and the restriction of your editing privileges.    <br />
        - The usage of automated tools for mass uploading and especially editing is highly discouraged due to the increased likelihood of compounding mistakes. Users are responsible for fixing problems they cause or risk the restriction of their editing privileges.    <br />
        - Avoid edit wars. If another user edits an entry to something different from what you had previously edited and you disagree with their edit, do not change it back, and instead notify Otaku Library staff by using the report function.    <br />
    </p>
